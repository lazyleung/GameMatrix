/**
 * Class <code>WaveletBPMDetector</code> can be used to
 * detect the tempo of a track in beats-per-minute.
 * The class implements the algorithm presented by
 * Tzanetakis, Essl and Cookin the paper titled
 * "Audio Analysis using the Discrete Wavelet Transform"
 *
 * To detect the tempo the discrete wavelet transform is used.
 * Track samples are divided into windows of frames.
 * For each window data are divided into 4 frequency sub-bands
 * through DWT. For each frequency sub-band an envelope is
 * extracted from the detail coffecients by:
 * 1) Full wave rectification (take the absolute value),
 * 2) Downsampling of the coefficients,
 * 3) Normalization (via mean removal)
 * These 4 sub-band envelopes are then summed together.
 * The resulting collection of data is then autocorrelated.
 * Peaks in the correlated data correspond to peaks in the
 * original signal.
 * then peaks are identified on the filtered data.
 * Given the position of such a peak the approximated
 * tempo of the window is computed and appended to a colletion.
 * Once all windows in the track are processed the beat-per-minute
 * value is returned as the median of the windows values.
